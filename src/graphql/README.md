# src/graphql (codegen-owned)

This folder is owned by Amplify codegen.

- Files here are generated by `amplify codegen` and may be deleted/recreated.
- Do **not** place hand-written code in this folder.

If you need custom GraphQL documents (e.g., minimal selection sets), put them under:
- `src/api/operationsMinimal.ts` (runtime minimal ops)

Guardrail:
- `npm run verify:codegen-graphql` ensures this folder contains only expected codegen output.
